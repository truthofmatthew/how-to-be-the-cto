### Introduction to T-testing

#### Overview
This paper explains T-testing, a statistical method used to compare the means of two groups to see if they are different. T-testing is useful for analyzing cohort data to determine if changes in a product affect user behavior. We will discuss what T-testing is, why it is important, and provide an example.

#### What is T-testing?
T-testing is a statistical test that compares the means of two groups to determine if they are significantly different from each other. It helps to see if changes in one group lead to different outcomes compared to another group.

#### Why is T-testing Important?
T-testing is important because it helps to:

- **Validate Changes:** Determine if changes made to a product have a significant impact.
- **Compare Groups:** Analyze if different user groups behave differently.
- **Make Informed Decisions:** Use data to make decisions based on statistical evidence.

#### Steps to Conduct a T-test

1. **Formulate Hypotheses:**
   - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference between the groups.
   - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a difference between the groups.

2. **Collect Data:**
   - Gather data for the groups you want to compare. For example, data from users before and after a product update.

3. **Calculate the Means:**
   - Calculate the average value for each group.

4. **Compute the T-statistic:**
   - Use a formula to compute the T-statistic, which measures the difference between the groups.

5. **Determine the P-value:**
   - The P-value indicates the probability that the results occurred by chance. A low P-value (< 0.05) suggests that the difference is significant.

6. **Make a Decision:**
   - If the P-value is low, reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the groups.

#### Example: Pre and Post Product Change

Imagine you made a change to your product and want to see if it affected user behavior. Hereâ€™s how you could use a T-test:

1. **Formulate Hypotheses:**
   - H0: There is no difference in user behavior before and after the change.
   - H1: There is a difference in user behavior before and after the change.

2. **Collect Data:**
   - Gather data on user engagement before and after the change.

3. **Calculate the Means:**
   - Compute the average engagement for users before the change and after the change.

4. **Compute the T-statistic:**
   - Use the T-test formula to calculate the T-statistic.

5. **Determine the P-value:**
   - Find the P-value to see if the difference is significant.

6. **Make a Decision:**
   - If the P-value is low, conclude that the change had a significant impact on user behavior.

### T-testing Example

#### Overview
This paper provides a detailed example of T-testing to show how to apply the method in real-world scenarios. T-testing is used to compare two groups and determine if their metrics differ significantly.

#### Example Scenario: Product Update

Imagine you work for an online service and recently updated the user interface. You want to know if the update affected user satisfaction.

#### Steps to Conduct the T-test

1. **Formulate Hypotheses:**
   - H0: There is no difference in user satisfaction before and after the update.
   - H1: There is a difference in user satisfaction before and after the update.

2. **Collect Data:**
   - Gather satisfaction scores from a sample of users before and after the update.

3. **Calculate the Means:**
   - Compute the average satisfaction score for users before the update and for users after the update.

4. **Compute the T-statistic:**
   - Use the T-test formula to calculate the T-statistic:
     \[
     T = \frac{\bar{X_1} - \bar{X_2}}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}
     \]
     where \(\bar{X_1}\) and \(\bar{X_2}\) are the means of the two groups, \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) are the standard deviations, and \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the sample sizes.

5. **Determine the P-value:**
   - Find the P-value to see if the difference is significant.

6. **Make a Decision:**
   - If the P-value is less than 0.05, reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the update significantly affected user satisfaction.

#### Example Analysis

1. **Formulate Hypotheses:**
   - H0: There is no difference in user satisfaction before and after the update.
   - H1: There is a difference in user satisfaction before and after the update.

2. **Collect Data:**
   - Satisfaction scores before update: [4, 5, 3, 4, 4]
   - Satisfaction scores after update: [5, 4, 5, 4, 5]

3. **Calculate the Means:**
   - Mean before update: 4.0
   - Mean after update: 4.6

4. **Compute the T-statistic:**
   - Calculate the standard deviations and sample sizes, then apply the T-test formula.

5. **Determine the P-value:**
   - Using a T-test calculator or statistical software, find the P-value.

6. **Make a Decision:**
   - If the P-value is low, conclude that the update significantly improved user satisfaction.

#### Conclusion
T-testing is a powerful tool for comparing two groups to see if their metrics differ significantly. By following the steps outlined and using real-world data, you can make informed decisions based on statistical evidence. This approach helps validate changes and improves overall strategy.
