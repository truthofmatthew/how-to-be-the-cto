# Day 16: Define MVP Scope

## Core Message
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a version of your product with just enough features to satisfy early adopters and provide valuable feedback for future development. Defining the MVP scope ensures that your team focuses on the most essential features first, allowing you to validate the product idea quickly and make improvements based on real user input.

## Key Concepts
1. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**:
   - An MVP includes only the core features necessary to address the primary problem for users.
   - It serves as a foundation to test the product concept and gather feedback with minimal resources.

2. **Core Features**:
   - Features that directly address the main user problem and deliver the core value of the product.
   - Prioritize these over nice-to-have features that don’t significantly impact the MVP’s value.

3. **User Feedback Loop**:
   - The MVP allows for quick feedback collection from users, helping validate assumptions, uncover additional needs, and guide further development.

4. **Risk Reduction**:
   - By focusing on essential features, the MVP approach minimizes the risk of investing in features that may not be useful or valued by users.

## Suggested Activity
1. **Identify Core Features**:
   - List all potential features for the product, then identify which ones are essential for solving the main user problem. Focus only on those that align with your product’s unique value proposition.

2. **Define MVP Scope**:
   - From the core features list, select only those necessary for the MVP. Create a separate list for additional features that can be added in future iterations.

3. **Set MVP Goals**:
   - Define specific, measurable goals for the MVP (e.g., achieve a 25% user retention rate in the first month) to help assess its effectiveness and guide further improvements.

4. **Plan for Feedback Collection**:
   - Outline methods for collecting feedback once the MVP is launched (e.g., surveys, user interviews) to gather insights on user satisfaction, usability, and potential areas for enhancement.
