### Example: Origin Source Sorting

#### Overview
This paper provides an example of how to sort and analyze metrics by their origin source using Udemy courses as a case study. Sorting metrics by where they come from helps understand the effectiveness of different channels, such as marketing campaigns or user acquisition methods.

#### Case Study: Udemy Courses

Imagine you are evaluating your Udemy courses as products. These courses vary in length, production quality, content quality, personality, market messaging, and features like quizzes or extra resources. Here’s how you can sort and analyze metrics by origin source for these courses.

#### Steps to Sort and Analyze Metrics by Origin Source

1. **Identify Origin Sources:**
   - Determine the different sources from which users come. These could include social media, email campaigns, search engines, or direct visits.
   - Example: Users can come from Facebook ads, Google searches, and Udemy’s internal promotions.

2. **Select Metrics to Track:**
   - Choose the key metrics that will help understand the effectiveness of each source. These could include enrollment rate, course completion rate, and user ratings.
   - Example: Track how many users from each source enroll in the course, complete the course, and rate it.

3. **Collect Data:**
   - Use analytics tools to gather data on these metrics for each origin source.
   - Example: Use Udemy’s analytics to track user acquisition by source and measure their behavior.

4. **Analyze Data:**
   - Compare the performance of different sources. Look for patterns or differences in user behavior.
   - Example: Compare enrollment rates and completion rates of users coming from Facebook ads versus those from Google searches.

5. **Interpret Results:**
   - Use the data to draw insights and understand which sources are most effective. Identify any significant trends or differences.
   - Example: If users from Udemy’s internal promotions have higher completion rates, it might be worth investing more in that channel.

6. **Adjust Strategy:**
   - Based on your findings, allocate resources to the most effective sources and make changes to improve underperforming ones.
   - Example: Increase budget for Google Ads if they bring more engaged users, and optimize Facebook ads to improve their performance.
