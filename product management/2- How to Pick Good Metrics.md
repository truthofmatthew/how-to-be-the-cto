### How to Pick Good Metrics

#### Overview
This paper explains how to choose good metrics for your product. Good metrics help you track progress and make smart decisions. We will discuss what makes a good metric, how to choose them, and give simple examples.

#### What Makes a Good Metric?
A good metric should be:
1. **Clear:** Easy to understand.
2. **Relevant:** Directly related to your goals.
3. **Actionable:** Can guide your actions and decisions.
4. **Comparable:** Can be compared over time or against other metrics.

#### Steps to Choose Good Metrics
1. **Identify Your Goals:**
   - Start by setting clear goals. For example, if you want to increase user engagement, your goal is clear.
2. **Brainstorm Possible Metrics:**
   - Think of different ways to measure your goal. For increasing engagement, possible metrics are the number of comments, likes, and shares.
3. **Evaluate Each Metric:**
   - Check if each metric is clear, relevant, actionable, and comparable. For example, the number of comments is a clear and relevant metric for engagement.
4. **Select the Best Metrics:**
   - Choose the metrics that best meet your criteria. For engagement, you might choose comments and shares.

#### Example: Facebook
Imagine you work at Facebook, and the goal is to keep people on the site longer. Here’s how you could choose metrics:
1. **Goal:** Increase time spent on Facebook.
2. **Possible Metrics:** Average session length, number of visits per user, and time spent on different features like photos or news feed.
3. **Evaluate Metrics:** 
   - **Average Session Length:** Clear and relevant.
   - **Number of Visits:** Relevant but might not show time spent.
   - **Time on Features:** Clear and shows where users spend time.
4. **Select Metrics:** Average session length and time on key features.

#### Rolling Up Metrics
Metrics can be combined to create top-level metrics. For example, at Facebook:
- **Top-Level Metric:** Total time spent on Facebook.
- **Sub-Metrics:** Time spent on photos, time spent on the news feed, time spent on videos.

These sub-metrics help understand what contributes to the top-level metric.

#### Avoiding Bad Metrics
Bad metrics can mislead and waste time. Here are common pitfalls:
- **Vanity Metrics:** Metrics that look good but don’t help make decisions. For example, total user count without engagement data.
- **Complex Metrics:** Hard to understand metrics can confuse. Stick to simple and clear metrics.
- **Irrelevant Metrics:** Metrics that don’t align with your goals. Focus only on what matters.

### Key Takeaways and Important Points
- **Understanding Metrics**: Metrics roll up into other metrics. Company-wide metrics might differ from team-specific metrics.
- **Exploratory vs Reporting Metrics**: 
  - **Exploratory Metrics**: Used for internal analysis and understanding user behavior.
  - **Reporting Metrics**: Tracked over time to measure the product's performance and direction.
- **Characteristics of Good Metrics**:
  1. **Understandable**: Simple and easily explainable.
  2. **Rate or Ratio**: Prefer ratios over absolute numbers to get meaningful insights (e.g., monthly active users vs. total users).
  3. **Correlation Awareness**: Avoid assuming causation from correlated metrics.
  4. **Actionable**: Choose metrics that can be influenced by your actions.
- **Examples**:
  - **Facebook**: Increasing comments can increase time spent on the platform.
  - **Twitter**: Exploratory metric might be button clicks, while a reporting metric is time spent on the platform.
  - **Airbnb**: Track the average number of nights booked per person rather than total nights booked.
- **Misleading Correlations**: Beware of misleading correlations (e.g., ice cream sales and drowning deaths).
- **Choosing Actionable Metrics**: 
  - Ensure the metrics chosen can be changed through actions.
  - Consider external constraints (e.g., user availability, e-commerce shopping frequency).
- **Summary of Good Metric Criteria**:
  - Understandable
  - Rates or ratios
  - Avoid misleading correlations
  - Actionable and changeable through efforts

### Conclusion
Choosing good metrics is key to tracking progress and making smart decisions. Good metrics should be clear, relevant, actionable, and comparable. By setting clear goals, brainstorming possible metrics, and evaluating them, you can select the best ones. Avoid vanity, complex, and irrelevant metrics to ensure you focus on what truly matters. This approach helps in making informed decisions and achieving your goals.
