# Day 24: Define Product Metrics Dashboard

## Core Message
A product metrics dashboard provides a centralized view of your product’s key performance indicators (KPIs), allowing you to monitor progress, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. A well-designed dashboard makes it easy to track success metrics in real-time, assess feature performance, and quickly identify areas for improvement.

## Key Concepts
1. **Dashboard Components**:
   - **KPIs**: Key metrics that reflect your product’s performance, such as user retention, conversion rate, and user engagement.
   - **Visualization**: Graphs, charts, and tables that make it easy to understand trends and compare data at a glance.
   - **Real-Time vs. Historical Data**: Real-time data helps monitor current performance, while historical data enables trend analysis and progress tracking.

2. **Common Metrics to Track**:
   - **User Acquisition**: Number of new users over time.
   - **Engagement**: Metrics like active users, session duration, and feature usage.
   - **Conversion Rate**: The percentage of users who complete specific goals (e.g., signups, purchases).
   - **Retention**: Percentage of users who return to the product over a set time frame.

3. **Tools for Building Dashboards**:
   - **Google Data Studio**: Free tool for creating customizable dashboards using data from Google Analytics and other sources.
   - **Tableau**: Powerful visualization tool, especially for complex datasets and custom views.
   - **Mixpanel Dashboards**: Built-in dashboards to track product metrics and user behavior.
