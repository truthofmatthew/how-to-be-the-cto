Reviewing feedback from your team and stakeholders allows you to evaluate the product’s alignment with initial goals and user needs. Analyzing feedback helps identify any overlooked issues, refine the product’s direction, and adjust future priorities. This ongoing feedback loop is essential to ensuring that the product evolves to meet user expectations and supports continuous improvement.
