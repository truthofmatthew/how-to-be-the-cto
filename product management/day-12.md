# Day 12: User Journey Mapping

## Core Message
User Journey Mapping is a powerful tool that helps visualize the user’s experience with your product from start to finish. By mapping out each step a user takes to accomplish a task, you can identify pain points, uncover opportunities for improvement, and prioritize features that enhance the overall experience.

## Key Concepts
1. **User Journey Map**:
   - A visual representation of the steps users take to accomplish a specific goal within your product.
   - Maps out stages like awareness, consideration, acquisition, use, and support.
   
2. **Touchpoints**:
   - Key moments where users interact with the product (e.g., onboarding, feature discovery, support).
   
3. **User Emotions and Pain Points**:
   - Mapping emotions alongside steps can reveal frustrations, gaps, or barriers that need to be addressed to improve the experience.

4. **Empathy and User-Centered Design**:
   - User journey mapping centers around understanding the user’s needs, feelings, and challenges at each step.

1. **Define User Goals**:

   - Identify the stages a user goes through to accomplish this goal. Common stages include:
     - **Awareness**: Discovering the product.
     - **Consideration**: Evaluating product options.
     - **Acquisition**: Signing up or purchasing.
     - **Use**: Actively engaging with the product.
     - **Support**: Receiving help if needed.

3. **Map Touchpoints and Emotions**:
   - Add key touchpoints within each stage. Consider the user’s emotions (e.g., excitement, frustration) and any pain points they might encounter.

4. **Identify Opportunities**:
   - Analyze the map for areas where the experience can be improved, such as simplifying onboarding or providing clearer instructions. Document these opportunities for future enhancements.
