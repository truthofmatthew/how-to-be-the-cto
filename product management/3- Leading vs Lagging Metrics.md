### Leading vs Lagging Metrics

#### Overview
This paper explains the difference between leading and lagging metrics. Understanding these types of metrics helps in predicting outcomes and measuring past performance. We will discuss what each type is, how to use them, and give simple examples.

#### What are Leading and Lagging Metrics?

- **Leading Metrics:**
  - Predict future outcomes.
  - Help to make changes before results are final.
  - Example: Number of new leads for a sales team, which can predict future sales.

- **Lagging Metrics:**
  - Measure past performance.
  - Show the results of actions already taken.
  - Example: Total sales revenue, which shows the result of past sales efforts.

#### How to Use Leading and Lagging Metrics

1. **Identify Goals:**
   - Define what you want to achieve. For instance, if you aim to increase sales, set a clear sales target.

2. **Choose Leading Metrics:**
   - Pick metrics that can predict your goal’s achievement. For sales, this could be the number of new customer inquiries.

3. **Choose Lagging Metrics:**
   - Pick metrics that measure the results. For sales, this would be the total revenue generated.

4. **Track and Adjust:**
   - Regularly monitor both types of metrics. Adjust your strategy based on what the leading metrics indicate.

#### Example: Smart Glasses Company

Imagine you are a product manager for a company making smart glasses. Here’s how you could use leading and lagging metrics:

1. **Goal:** Increase product sales.
2. **Leading Metrics:**
   - Number of product demos given.
   - Customer interest levels (e.g., inquiries, website visits).
3. **Lagging Metrics:**
   - Number of units sold.
   - Total revenue from sales.

By tracking the number of demos and customer interest, you can predict future sales. If interest is high, you can expect sales to increase. Total units sold and revenue will tell you how well your strategy worked.

#### Problems with Metrics

- **Over-Reliance on Lagging Metrics:**
  - Focusing too much on past performance can make it hard to react quickly to changes.
  
- **Ignoring Leading Metrics:**
  - Not paying attention to predictive metrics can result in missed opportunities to improve.

#### Avoiding Metric Pitfalls

1. **Balance Both Metrics:**
   - Use a mix of leading and lagging metrics to get a full picture.
2. **Regular Review:**
   - Continuously review and adjust your metrics to stay on track.
3. **Clear Definitions:**
   - Make sure everyone understands what each metric means and how it is used.

#### Conclusion
Understanding and using leading and lagging metrics is crucial for effective product management. Leading metrics help predict future success and allow for proactive changes. Lagging metrics measure past performance and help assess the results of your actions. By balancing both types of metrics, setting clear goals, and regularly reviewing your strategy, you can make informed decisions and achieve better outcomes.
