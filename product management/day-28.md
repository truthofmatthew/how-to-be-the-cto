# Day 28: Product Documentation and Handoff

## Core Message
Product documentation is crucial for providing developers, designers, and other team members with a clear understanding of the product’s requirements, goals, and features. A thorough handoff ensures that all relevant information is readily available, reducing misunderstandings and enabling efficient implementation. Good documentation improves collaboration and helps maintain product quality throughout development.

## Key Concepts
1. **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**:
   - A detailed document outlining the product’s vision, goals, features, user stories, and acceptance criteria. This serves as a blueprint for developers and designers.

2. **User Stories and Acceptance Criteria**:
   - User stories describe what each feature does from the user’s perspective, while acceptance criteria outline the conditions a feature must meet to be considered complete.

3. **Technical Documentation**:
   - Includes technical requirements, API specifications, and any backend or integration needs. This helps developers understand the technical structure and dependencies.

4. **Design Specifications**:
   - Final mockups, wireframes, and design guidelines (e.g., colors, fonts) to ensure the product matches the intended visual and functional design.

5. **Handoff Process**:
   - A structured meeting or document review with the development team to go over the documentation, clarify requirements, and answer any outstanding questions.
