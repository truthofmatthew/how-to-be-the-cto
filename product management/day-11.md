# Day 11: Feature Definition and Roadmapping

## Core Message
Defining and organizing product features into a roadmap helps translate your product vision into actionable steps. A roadmap provides a timeline and structure, allowing you to prioritize features, communicate goals to stakeholders, and plan for iterative development.

## Key Concepts
1. **Feature Definition**:
   - Clearly define each feature based on user needs, value proposition, and feedback. A well-defined feature includes a description, purpose, and priority level.

2. **Product Roadmap**:
   - A strategic document that outlines the timeline for feature development, organized by phases. Typical phases include:
     - **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: Core features to test viability.
     - **Post-MVP**: Additional features based on user feedback and analytics.
     - **Future Features**: Long-term ideas for product evolution.

3. **Types of Roadmaps**:
   - **Timeline-Based Roadmap**: Prioritizes features based on specific deadlines or milestones.
   - **Theme-Based Roadmap**: Groups features around themes or user goals instead of strict timelines.
   - **Outcome-Based Roadmap**: Organizes features by desired outcomes, such as increasing retention or engagement.

## Suggested Activity
1. **List Key Features for MVP and Beyond**:
   - Identify core features for the MVP that align with your KPIs and user needs. List additional features that can be added post-MVP to enhance the product.

2. **Choose a Roadmap Style**:
   - Based on your product and team needs, choose a roadmap style (Timeline-Based, Theme-Based, or Outcome-Based). If your product has strict deadlines, opt for a Timeline-Based roadmap; if flexibility is key, consider a Theme- or Outcome-Based roadmap.

3. **Create an Initial Product Roadmap**:
   - Organize features by release phase (MVP, Post-MVP, Future Features) and add them to your roadmap. Include target completion dates or specific outcomes, depending on the roadmap style chosen.

4. **Share Roadmap for Feedback**:
   - Review the roadmap with your team or stakeholders to ensure alignment. Make adjustments as needed based on feedback.
