### Key Takeaways and Important Points Combined with Metrics by Cohort

#### Key Takeaways and Important Points

- **Cohort Concept**: A cohort is a group of users segmented by the time they first interacted with your business. This helps in understanding user behavior based on when they joined.
  
- **Changes Impact Analysis**: Major changes to a product can impact different user cohorts differently. Analyzing metrics immediately after changes might not give a complete picture.

- **User Behavior**: User interactions and perceptions of a product are influenced by their past experiences with it. Legacy users may react differently to changes compared to new users.

- **Cohort Analysis**: This involves comparing the behavior of users who joined at different times to understand how changes impact different user groups. It's a critical tool for avoiding misinterpretations in metrics analysis.

- **Product Management Strategy**: Depending on the priorities, a company might focus on training old users on new features or cater more to new users who adapt quickly to changes.

- **Practical Example**: The example of Yelp's app changes illustrates how different cohorts (old vs. new users) might show varied responses to the same changes, highlighting the importance of considering cohort analysis in decision-making.

### Metrics by Cohort

#### Overview
This paper explains how to use metrics by cohort. Cohorts are groups of users with shared characteristics, such as the time they started using a product. Using cohorts helps to understand user behavior over time. We will discuss what cohorts are, why they matter, and how to use them with simple examples.

#### What are Cohorts?
Cohorts are groups of users who share a common trait, such as the month they signed up for a service. Tracking these groups over time helps identify patterns and trends in user behavior.

#### Why Cohorts Matter
Using cohorts allows you to see how different groups of users behave over time. This can highlight issues or successes that are not visible in overall metrics. For example, if a product update improves retention for new users but not for existing users, cohort analysis will reveal this.

#### How to Use Cohorts

1. **Identify Cohorts:**
   - Decide on the characteristic to group users by. For example, users who signed up in January form one cohort, February users form another, and so on.

2. **Collect Data:**
   - Gather data on user behavior for each cohort. This could include metrics like retention rate, engagement, and conversion rate.

3. **Analyze Trends:**
   - Compare how different cohorts perform over time. Look for patterns or changes after events like product updates.

4. **Make Adjustments:**
   - Use insights from cohort analysis to improve your product. For instance, if a specific cohort shows low engagement, investigate and address the issue.

#### Example: Yelp
Imagine you work on the mobile app for Yelp, which lists local businesses and allows user reviews. Here’s how you could use cohort analysis:

1. **Identify Cohorts:**
   - Group users by the month they first used the app.

2. **Collect Data:**
   - Track metrics like how often users return to the app, how many reviews they post, and their overall engagement.

3. **Analyze Trends:**
   - Compare engagement rates for users who joined in different months. Check if a recent app update affected new users differently from older users.

4. **Make Adjustments:**
   - If new users show lower engagement, you might tweak the onboarding process to make the app easier to use.

#### Problems with Cohort Analysis

- **Data Overload:** Tracking too many cohorts can become complex and overwhelming.
- **Misinterpretation:** It’s easy to misinterpret data without proper context.
- **Time-Consuming:** Collecting and analyzing data for different cohorts can be time-consuming.

#### Avoiding Problems

1. **Focus on Key Metrics:** Track the most important metrics that align with your goals.
2. **Provide Context:** Always consider the context of your data to avoid misinterpretation.
3. **Automate Where Possible:** Use tools to automate data collection and analysis to save time.

#### Conclusion
Using metrics by cohort helps to understand user behavior over time and identify trends that might be missed with overall metrics. By grouping users with common traits, collecting relevant data, and analyzing trends, you can make informed decisions to improve your product. Avoiding data overload, misinterpretation, and using automation can help manage the complexity of cohort analysis. This approach leads to better insights and more effective strategies.
