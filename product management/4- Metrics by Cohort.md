### Key Takeaways and Important Points Combined with Metrics by Cohort

#### Cohort Concept
A cohort is a group of users segmented by the time they first interacted with your business. This segmentation helps in understanding user behavior based on when they joined.

#### Changes Impact Analysis
Major changes to a product can impact different user cohorts differently. Analyzing metrics immediately after changes might not give a complete picture.

#### User Behavior
User interactions and perceptions of a product are influenced by their past experiences with it. Legacy users may react differently to changes compared to new users.

#### Cohort Analysis
Cohort analysis involves comparing the behavior of users who joined at different times to understand how changes impact different user groups. It's a critical tool for avoiding misinterpretations in metrics analysis.

#### Product Management Strategy
Depending on the priorities, a company might focus on training old users on new features or cater more to new users who adapt quickly to changes.

#### Practical Example
The example of Yelp's app changes illustrates how different cohorts (old vs. new users) might show varied responses to the same changes, highlighting the importance of considering cohort analysis in decision-making.

### Metrics by Cohort

#### Overview
This section explains how to use metrics by cohort. Cohorts are groups of users with shared characteristics, such as the time they started using a product. Using cohorts helps to understand user behavior over time.

#### What are Cohorts?
Cohorts are groups of users who share a common trait, such as the month they signed up for a service. Tracking these groups over time helps identify patterns and trends in user behavior.

#### Why Cohorts Matter
Using cohorts allows you to see how different groups of users behave over time. This can highlight issues or successes that are not visible in overall metrics. For example, if a product update improves retention for new users but not for existing users, cohort analysis will reveal this.

#### How to Use Cohorts

1. **Identify Cohorts:**
   - Decide on the characteristic to group users by. For example, users who signed up in January form one cohort, February users form another, and so on.

2. **Collect Data:**
   - Gather data on user behavior for each cohort. This could include metrics like retention rate, engagement, and conversion rate.

3. **Analyze Trends:**
   - Compare how different cohorts perform over time. Look for patterns or changes after events like product updates.

4. **Make Adjustments:**
   - Use insights from cohort analysis to improve your product. For instance, if a specific cohort shows low engagement, investigate and address the issue.

#### Example: Yelp
Imagine you work on the mobile app for Yelp, which lists local businesses and allows user reviews. Here’s how you could use cohort analysis:

1. **Identify Cohorts:**
   - Group users by the month they first used the app.

2. **Collect Data:**
   - Track metrics like how often users return to the app, how many reviews they post, and their overall engagement.

3. **Analyze Trends:**
   - Compare engagement rates for users who joined in different months. Check if a recent app update affected new users differently from older users.

4. **Make Adjustments:**
   - If new users show lower engagement, you might tweak the onboarding process to make the app easier to use.

### Problems with Cohort Analysis

1. **Data Overload:**
   - Tracking too many cohorts can become complex and overwhelming.

2. **Misinterpretation:**
   - It’s easy to misinterpret data without proper context.

3. **Time-Consuming:**
   - Collecting and analyzing data for different cohorts can be time-consuming.

### Avoiding Problems

1. **Focus on Key Metrics:**
   - Track the most important metrics that align with your goals.

2. **Provide Context:**
   - Always consider the context of your data to avoid misinterpretation.

3. **Automate Where Possible:**
   - Use tools to automate data collection and analysis to save time.

### Conclusion
Using metrics by cohort helps to understand user behavior over time and identify trends that might be missed with overall metrics. By grouping users with common traits, collecting relevant data, and analyzing trends, you can make informed decisions to improve your product. Avoiding data overload, misinterpretation, and using automation can help manage the complexity of cohort analysis. This approach leads to better insights and more effective strategies.

### How to Design a Cohort Analysis

#### Overview
This section explains how to design a cohort analysis. Cohort analysis groups users based on shared characteristics, like the time they started using a product, to see how their behavior changes over time. This helps to understand different user reactions and trends.

#### Steps to Design a Cohort Analysis

1. **Define Your Cohorts:**
   - Identify the characteristic to group users by. For example, users who signed up in the same month.

2. **Select Metrics to Track:**
   - Choose the key metrics that will help you understand user behavior. These could be retention rate, engagement, or conversion rate.

3. **Collect Data:**
   - Gather data on the chosen metrics for each cohort. Use analytics tools to help with data collection.

4. **Analyze Data:**
   - Compare the performance of different cohorts over time. Look for patterns or changes in behavior.

5. **Interpret Results:**
   - Use the data to draw insights and understand user behavior. Identify any significant trends or differences.

6. **Adjust Strategy:**
   - Based on your findings, make changes to improve user experience and achieve your goals.

#### Example: Mobile App for Yelp

Imagine you work on the mobile app for Yelp, which lists local businesses and allows user reviews. Here’s how you could design a cohort analysis:

1. **Define Your Cohorts:**
   - Group users by the month they first used the app.

2. **Select Metrics to Track:**
   - Track metrics like login frequency, number of reviews posted, and time spent on the app.

3. **Collect Data:**
   - Use Yelp’s internal analytics tools to gather data on these metrics for each cohort.

4. **Analyze Data:**
   - Compare login frequency and review posting rates for users who joined in different months.

5. **Interpret Results:**
   - Identify if certain cohorts are more active than others and explore why this might be.

6. **Adjust Strategy:**
   - If new users show lower engagement, improve the onboarding process to better introduce the app’s features.

#### Challenges with Cohort Analysis

1. **Data Overload:**
   - Tracking too many cohorts can be complex.

2. **Misinterpretation:**
   - Data without proper context can be misleading.

3. **Time-Consuming:**
   - Gathering and analyzing data can take a lot of time.

#### Avoiding Challenges

1. **Focus on Key Metrics:**
   - Track only the most important metrics.

2. **Provide Context:**
   - Always consider the context of your data.

3. **Automate Data Collection:**
   - Use tools to automate the process and save time.

### Conclusion
Designing a cohort analysis helps to understand user behavior over time and identify trends that might be missed with overall metrics. By defining cohorts, selecting key metrics, and collecting and analyzing data, you can gain valuable insights to improve your product. Avoiding common challenges ensures a more effective and manageable analysis. This approach leads to better decisions and improved user experience.
