### Metrics with Origin Source Sorting

#### Overview
This paper explains how to sort and analyze metrics by their origin source. Sorting metrics by where they come from helps understand the effectiveness of different channels, such as marketing campaigns or user acquisition methods. We will discuss the steps to sort and analyze metrics by origin source and provide examples.

#### Why Sort Metrics by Origin Source?
Sorting metrics by their origin source allows you to see which channels are most effective. This helps allocate resources better and improve overall strategy. For example, you can see if users from social media are more engaged than those from email campaigns.

#### Steps to Sort and Analyze Metrics by Origin Source

1. **Identify Origin Sources:**
   - Determine the different sources from which users come. These could include social media, email campaigns, search engines, or direct visits.
   - Example: Users can come from Facebook, Google Ads, and email newsletters.

2. **Select Metrics to Track:**
   - Choose the key metrics that will help understand the effectiveness of each source. These could include conversion rate, engagement rate, and retention rate.
   - Example: Track how many users from each source sign up, how often they log in, and how long they stay engaged.

3. **Collect Data:**
   - Use analytics tools to gather data on these metrics for each origin source.
   - Example: Use Google Analytics to track user acquisition by source and measure their behavior.

4. **Analyze Data:**
   - Compare the performance of different sources. Look for patterns or differences in user behavior.
   - Example: Compare conversion rates of users coming from Facebook versus those from email newsletters.

5. **Interpret Results:**
   - Use the data to draw insights and understand which sources are most effective. Identify any significant trends or differences.
   - Example: If users from Google Ads have higher engagement, it might be worth investing more in that channel.

6. **Adjust Strategy:**
   - Based on your findings, allocate resources to the most effective sources and make changes to improve underperforming ones.
   - Example: Increase budget for Google Ads and optimize email campaigns to boost engagement.

#### Challenges with Origin Source Sorting

- **Data Complexity:** Sorting and analyzing data from multiple sources can be complex.
- **Attribution Issues:** Determining the exact source of user acquisition can be tricky, especially with multi-channel strategies.
- **Time-Consuming:** Collecting and analyzing data for each source can take a lot of time.

#### Avoiding Challenges

1. **Use Automation Tools:** Employ tools that automate data collection and sorting.
2. **Clear Attribution Models:** Define clear models to attribute user acquisition accurately.
3. **Focus on Key Metrics:** Track the most important metrics to keep analysis manageable.

#### Conclusion
Sorting and analyzing metrics by origin source helps to understand the effectiveness of different channels. By identifying sources, selecting key metrics, collecting and analyzing data, you can gain valuable insights to improve your strategy. Avoiding common challenges ensures a more effective and efficient analysis. This approach leads to better resource allocation and improved user acquisition and engagement.

### Key Takeaways and Important Points

1. **Understanding Origin Source:**
   - Different acquisition channels result in different user behaviors.
   - Sorting metrics by origin source is crucial for understanding changes in key metrics.
   - Paid channels, organic sources, and social media ads each attract users with varying intent and behaviors.

2. **Impact of Marketing Channels:**
   - Low intent leads (e.g., Facebook ads) versus high intent leads (e.g., Google search ads) significantly impact conversion rates.
   - Marketing strategies and segmentation (e.g., income targeting) can affect both conversion rates and average customer value.

3. **Metrics Interpretation:**
   - Key metrics for products include revenue, average review rating, average minutes consumed, student growth rate, and conversion rate.
   - Metrics fluctuate due to various factors including marketing efforts, user source, and time of year.
   - Regular analysis and understanding of these fluctuations help in making informed decisions.

4. **Marketing and Growth:**
   - Companies grow by finding and exhausting low-scale, niche marketing channels before moving to larger, more challenging ones.
   - Example of Airbnb using Craigslist initially before moving to paid search and SEO.

5. **Product Review Trends:**
   - Product reviews can vary widely even without changes in the product itself.
   - Initial high ratings from loyal customers or early adopters can decline as the product reaches a broader, less targeted audience.
   - Ratings may increase again once marketing efforts cease and the product is organically discovered by high-intent users.

6. **Conversion Rate Variability:**
   - Conversion rates can vary drastically on a daily basis due to small, local changes like recommendation widgets, subpage features, or email campaigns.
   - Different types of users (e.g., search students vs. paid acquisition students) have different conversion rates.

7. **Role of Marketing in User Behavior:**
   - Marketing campaigns and the origin of users significantly influence product metrics.
   - Marketers often switch channels due to scale limitations or the need for better metrics.
   - Each channel switch brings new user behaviors and preferences which impact downstream product metrics.

8. **Coordination with Marketing Team:**
   - Ensure synchronization with the marketing team to anticipate and understand changes in traffic sources.
   - Routinely run origin source sorting to maintain clarity on the impact of various acquisition channels on key metrics.

### Example: Origin Source Sorting

#### Overview
This paper provides an example of how to sort and analyze metrics by their origin source using Udemy courses as a case study. Sorting metrics by where they come from helps understand the effectiveness of different channels, such as marketing campaigns or user acquisition methods.

#### Case Study: Udemy Courses

Imagine you are evaluating your Udemy courses as products. These courses vary in length, production quality, content quality, personality, market messaging, and features like quizzes or extra resources. Here’s how you can sort and analyze metrics by origin source for these courses.

#### Steps to Sort and Analyze Metrics by Origin Source

1. **Identify Origin Sources:**
   - Determine the different sources from which users come. These could include social media, email campaigns, search engines, or direct visits.
   - Example: Users can come from Facebook ads, Google searches, and Udemy’s internal promotions.

2. **Select Metrics to Track:**
   - Choose the key metrics that will help understand the effectiveness of each source. These could include enrollment rate, course completion rate, and user ratings.
   - Example: Track how many users from each source enroll in the course, complete the course, and rate it.

3. **Collect Data:**
   - Use analytics tools to gather data on these metrics for each origin source.
   - Example: Use Udemy’s analytics to track user acquisition by source and measure their behavior.

4. **Analyze Data:**
