### Metrics with Origin Source Sorting

#### Overview
This paper explains how to sort and analyze metrics by their origin source. Sorting metrics by where they come from helps understand the effectiveness of different channels, such as marketing campaigns or user acquisition methods. We will discuss the steps to sort and analyze metrics by origin source and provide examples.

#### Why Sort Metrics by Origin Source?
Sorting metrics by their origin source allows you to see which channels are most effective. This helps allocate resources better and improve overall strategy. For example, you can see if users from social media are more engaged than those from email campaigns.

#### Steps to Sort and Analyze Metrics by Origin Source

1. **Identify Origin Sources:**
   - Determine the different sources from which users come. These could include social media, email campaigns, search engines, or direct visits.
   - Example: Users can come from Facebook, Google Ads, and email newsletters.

2. **Select Metrics to Track:**
   - Choose the key metrics that will help understand the effectiveness of each source. These could include conversion rate, engagement rate, and retention rate.
   - Example: Track how many users from each source sign up, how often they log in, and how long they stay engaged.

3. **Collect Data:**
   - Use analytics tools to gather data on these metrics for each origin source.
   - Example: Use Google Analytics to track user acquisition by source and measure their behavior.

4. **Analyze Data:**
   - Compare the performance of different sources. Look for patterns or differences in user behavior.
   - Example: Compare conversion rates of users coming from Facebook versus those from email newsletters.

5. **Interpret Results:**
   - Use the data to draw insights and understand which sources are most effective. Identify any significant trends or differences.
   - Example: If users from Google Ads have higher engagement, it might be worth investing more in that channel.

6. **Adjust Strategy:**
   - Based on your findings, allocate resources to the most effective sources and make changes to improve underperforming ones.
   - Example: Increase budget for Google Ads and optimize email campaigns to boost engagement.

#### Example: Online Bank

Imagine you work for an online bank called Simple, which has no physical branches. Here’s how you could sort and analyze metrics by origin source:

1. **Identify Origin Sources:**
   - Users can come from social media ads, search engines, and referral programs.

2. **Select Metrics to Track:**
   - Track metrics like sign-up rate, number of transactions, and user retention.

3. **Collect Data:**
   - Use the bank’s analytics tools to gather data on these metrics for each origin source.

4. **Analyze Data:**
   - Compare sign-up rates and transaction numbers for users coming from social media, search engines, and referrals.

5. **Interpret Results:**
   - Identify which source brings the most engaged users and generates the most transactions.

6. **Adjust Strategy:**
   - Invest more in the channels that bring the best users and improve strategies for other channels.

#### Challenges with Origin Source Sorting

- **Data Complexity:** Sorting and analyzing data from multiple sources can be complex.
- **Attribution Issues:** Determining the exact source of user acquisition can be tricky, especially with multi-channel strategies.
- **Time-Consuming:** Collecting and analyzing data for each source can take a lot of time.

#### Avoiding Challenges

1. **Use Automation Tools:** Employ tools that automate data collection and sorting.
2. **Clear Attribution Models:** Define clear models to attribute user acquisition accurately.
3. **Focus on Key Metrics:** Track the most important metrics to keep analysis manageable.

#### Conclusion
Sorting and analyzing metrics by origin source helps to understand the effectiveness of different channels. By identifying sources, selecting key metrics, collecting and analyzing data, you can gain valuable insights to improve your strategy. Avoiding common challenges ensures a more effective and efficient analysis. This approach leads to better resource allocation and improved user acquisition and engagement.
