# Day 7: Prioritize User Needs

## Core Message
Prioritizing user needs is essential to building a product that addresses the most critical problems and delivers maximum value. This step involves ranking features and tasks based on their impact on user satisfaction, business objectives, and resource availability. Using prioritization frameworks helps ensure that development efforts focus on the most valuable outcomes.

## Key Concepts
1. **Prioritization Frameworks**:
   - **MoSCoW Method**: Classifies features into Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, and Wonâ€™t-have.
   - **RICE Scoring**: Rates features based on Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort, producing a score that helps rank items.
   - **Kano Model**: Categorizes features into Basic Needs, Performance Needs, and Delighters to understand their impact on user satisfaction.

2. **Impact vs. Effort Matrix**:
   - A visual tool for mapping tasks based on their impact (value) and effort (cost), allowing you to focus on high-impact, low-effort tasks first.

3. **User Story Mapping**:
   - A technique to organize features based on user journeys, helping visualize how users interact with the product and prioritize features that align with key steps.

## Suggested Activity
1. **List Product Features**:
   - Make a comprehensive list of potential features and improvements for your product based on user needs and business goals.

2. **Apply MoSCoW or RICE**:
   - Use either the MoSCoW or RICE method to categorize each feature. For RICE, score each feature for Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort.

3. **Map Features Using Impact vs. Effort Matrix**:
   - Plot features on an Impact vs. Effort Matrix, identifying which tasks provide high impact with low effort and should be prioritized.

4. **Create a User Story Map**:
   - Organize the prioritized features along the user journey, focusing on features that align with critical touchpoints and improve the user experience.
