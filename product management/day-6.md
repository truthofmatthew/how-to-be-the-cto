# Day 6: Define Product Vision and Strategy

## Core Message
The product vision is a high-level statement that defines the long-term goal of the product, while the strategy outlines how you’ll achieve that vision. Together, these elements provide a guiding north star that aligns the entire team and informs every decision made in the product lifecycle.

## Key Concepts
1. **Product Vision**:
   - A short, inspiring statement describing what you aim to achieve with the product.
   - Answers the question, “What impact do we want this product to have on our users and the world?”

2. **Product Strategy**:
   - The approach you’ll take to achieve the vision, including target audience, key features, and competitive positioning.
   - Involves setting priorities, defining the unique value the product offers, and outlining steps to reach short-term and long-term goals.

3. **Vision Statement**:
   - A one-sentence summary of the product's ultimate purpose (e.g., “To make healthy eating simple and accessible for everyone”).

4. **Strategic Objectives**:
   - Tangible goals that provide structure to the strategy, often in areas like customer satisfaction, market share, revenue growth, or user engagement.
