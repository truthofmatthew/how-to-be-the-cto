# Day 13: Develop Wireframes and Mockups

## Core Message
Wireframes and mockups are visual blueprints of your product that outline the layout, functionality, and user interface elements without focusing on design details. Wireframes are low-fidelity sketches, while mockups add more visual detail. They help communicate the product’s structure, receive feedback, and make adjustments before actual development begins.

## Key Concepts
1. **Wireframes**:
   - Basic, low-fidelity sketches showing the layout and arrangement of UI elements (e.g., buttons, text fields).
   - Focus on structure, functionality, and user flow rather than visual design.

2. **Mockups**:
   - High-fidelity, more detailed representations of the product that include colors, fonts, and visual details.
   - Used for design validation and to communicate the final look and feel of the product.

3. **Tools for Wireframing and Mockups**:
   - **Figma**: Collaborative design tool for creating wireframes, mockups, and prototypes.
   - **Sketch**: Popular for wireframes and mockups, particularly among designers.
   - **Balsamiq**: Known for simple, low-fidelity wireframes, ideal for early-stage design.

4. **Feedback on Visual Layout**:
   - Early visual feedback is essential to ensure that the design meets user needs, aligns with business goals, and is technically feasible.

## Suggested Activity
1. **Choose a Wireframing Tool**:
   - Pick one of the recommended tools, such as Figma or Balsamiq, based on your needs and familiarity.

2. **Create Low-Fidelity Wireframes**:
   - Start with a low-fidelity wireframe for key screens (e.g., home screen, onboarding). Focus on structure and placement of elements rather than detailed design.

3. **Develop Mockups for Core Screens**:
   - Convert your wireframes to mockups for core screens, adding color, typography, and visual hierarchy to illustrate the final look and feel.

4. **Get Feedback on Wireframes and Mockups**:
   - Share the wireframes and mockups with team members or potential users. Collect feedback on usability, layout, and visual appeal, and make any necessary adjustments.
