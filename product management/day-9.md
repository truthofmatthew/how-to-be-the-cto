# Day 9: Identify Success Metrics (KPIs)

## Core Message
Defining success metrics, or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), is essential to measure whether your product is meeting its objectives. KPIs give you quantifiable goals, helping to track progress, make informed decisions, and validate assumptions throughout the product lifecycle. Choose metrics that align with your product’s goals and impact user engagement, satisfaction, and business growth.

## Key Concepts
1. **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**:
   - Metrics used to evaluate the product’s performance relative to specific objectives.
   - Common KPIs include:
     - **User Acquisition**: Number of new users over time.
     - **Retention Rate**: Percentage of users who continue using the product.
     - **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)**: Measures how happy users are with the product.
     - **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: Likelihood of users recommending the product to others.

2. **Pirate Metrics (AARRR)**:
   - A framework that breaks down KPIs into five stages:
     - **Acquisition**: How users find your product.
     - **Activation**: First positive experience.
     - **Retention**: How often users return.
     - **Referral**: Whether users recommend the product.
     - **Revenue**: How the product generates income.

3. **North Star Metric (NSM)**:
   - The single most important metric that reflects your product’s value and long-term growth potential.

## Suggested Activity
1. **Select Key KPIs**:
   - Choose 3-5 KPIs based on your product’s objectives and user journey. For example:
     - **Acquisition**: Number of signups per month
     - **Activation**: Percentage of users completing onboarding
     - **Retention**: Monthly user retention rate
     - **Customer Satisfaction**: Average CSAT score from user feedback

2. **Define Your North Star Metric**:
   - Identify a single metric that best represents your product’s core value to users. For instance, if your product is a collaboration tool, your NSM could be “active collaboration sessions per user.”

3. **Create a Metrics Dashboard Outline**:
   - Plan a simple dashboard to track these metrics over time. Include target values, current values, and visual indicators (e.g., graphs or charts) for easy monitoring.

4. **Set Baseline Targets**:
   - Set initial targets for each KPI. These targets can be refined later as you collect more data and learn user behavior patterns.
