### When to Use Data vs. Intuition

#### Overview
This paper discusses when to use data and when to rely on intuition in decision-making. It is important for product managers to understand the balance between these two approaches. We will discuss the concepts of being data-driven versus data-informed, and provide guidelines on when to use data or intuition.

#### Data-Driven vs. Data-Informed

- **Data-Driven:**
  - Decisions are based solely on data analysis.
  - Useful when you have clear, reliable data.
  - Example: Running A/B tests to determine which version of a webpage performs better.

- **Data-Informed:**
  - Decisions are guided by data, but also consider other factors like experience and context.
  - Useful when data is not enough or when human judgment is crucial.
  - Example: Deciding on a product feature based on user feedback and market trends.

#### When to Use Data

1. **Clear, Reliable Data:**
   - When you have accurate and sufficient data that directly relates to the decision.
   - Example: Choosing the best-performing ad campaign based on click-through rates.

2. **Repeatable Situations:**
   - When the decision is about something that occurs regularly and can be measured consistently.
   - Example: Optimizing delivery routes for efficiency based on historical traffic data.

3. **High Stakes:**
   - When the decision has significant consequences and requires evidence to support it.
   - Example: Launching a new product line based on market research and sales projections.

#### When to Use Intuition

1. **Lack of Data:**
   - When there is insufficient data or the data is unreliable.
   - Example: Entering a new market where little data is available.

2. **New and Unique Situations:**
   - When facing a unique situation that data cannot fully address.
   - Example: Responding to an unexpected market shift.

3. **Creativity and Innovation:**
   - When decisions require creative thinking and innovation that data cannot predict.
   - Example: Designing a new marketing campaign to create brand awareness.

#### Guidelines for Balancing Data and Intuition

1. **Use Data to Inform Intuition:**
   - Let data guide your instincts but don’t let it override your experience and insight.
   - Example: Use customer surveys to inform product design but rely on your experience to finalize the design.

2. **Validate Intuition with Data:**
   - Use data to support or challenge your intuitive decisions whenever possible.
   - Example: If you feel a new feature will be popular, back it up with user testing data.

3. **Combine Both Approaches:**
   - Use a combination of data and intuition to make well-rounded decisions.
   - Example: Analyze sales data and use your market knowledge to plan the next quarter’s strategy.

#### Example Scenario

Imagine you are a product manager deciding whether to add a new feature to your app. Here’s how to balance data and intuition:

1. **Use Data:**
   - Gather user feedback, analyze usage data, and check market trends.

2. **Use Intuition:**
   - Consider your experience with user behavior and your understanding of the market.

3. **Combine Both:**
   - If data shows users want the feature and your intuition tells you it aligns with market trends, proceed with development.

#### Conclusion
Balancing data and intuition is key to effective decision-making. Use data when it is reliable and relevant, and rely on intuition when data is lacking or when creative thinking is required. By combining both approaches, product managers can make informed and innovative decisions that lead to better outcomes.
