### Effective Team Structure in UTMS

Understanding how to structure teams in a Unified Team Management System (UTMS) can greatly impact the efficiency and success of projects. Hereâ€™s a concise guide on different team structures and their practical applications.

#### Tech-Oriented Teams
Tech-oriented teams focus on specific technical areas. This structure can speed up development and enhance expertise sharing within the team.

- **Examples:**
  - Development Team
  - System Analysis Team
  - Infrastructure Team

**Pros:**
- Faster development cycles.
- Deep technical expertise and shared knowledge.

**Cons:**
- Harder for business owners to manage resources.
- Potential conflicts over resource allocation.

#### Product-Oriented Teams
Product-oriented teams focus on specific products or services. They are better aligned with business goals and client needs.

- **Examples:**
  - Mobile Application Team
  - Client Management System Team

**Pros:**
- Better understanding of business needs and client requirements.
- More client-centric approach.

**Cons:**
- Slower development due to broader focus.
- Requires more coordination between different product teams.

#### Middle Team
A middle team bridges the gap between business needs and technical implementation. This team can effectively allocate tasks and manage resources.

- **Examples:**
  - Digital Team
  - Business Analysis Team

**Pros:**
- Ensures alignment between business and technical teams.
- Better resource management and task allocation.

**Cons:**
- Adds another layer of management.
- Requires clear communication channels.

#### Example Scenario
Imagine you run a software company with multiple projects. You can have a tech-oriented team focusing on infrastructure, ensuring that all products use a consistent and optimized technical base. Meanwhile, product-oriented teams focus on specific apps or services, tailoring them to client needs. A middle team of business analysts coordinates between these groups, ensuring that business goals align with technical capabilities.
