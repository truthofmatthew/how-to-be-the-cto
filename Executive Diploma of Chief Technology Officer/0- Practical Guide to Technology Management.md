### Practical Guide to Technology Management

**Introduction:**
This guide is for CIOs, CTOs, IT managers, and anyone interested in technology management. It covers technology planning, development models, contract and vendor management, team structuring, and process efficiency.

**Key Points:**
1. **Technology Planning:**
   - Align tech plans with company goals.
   - Use vendor roadmaps and industry benchmarks.
     - Company Strategy / Products Roadmap 3 Y
     - Vendors Platforms Roadmap Plan (Core Software, CRM, Digital Platforms, cloud services) / Industry Analysis
     - Startups Scouting / Open innovations
     - Product / Service / Platform Model shift = uberization / booking
     - Baas / Saas = your business as service
     - Strategic Merge & Acquisition = cheaper buy vendor than buy solution
     - inHouse vs Purchasing
     - Scalability
     - IT strategy and Tech roadmap linked to business activities = calculated ROI for each activity / calculated allocated ROI for platforms and infrastructure.
     - The first stage of good technology planning is analysis of company strategy and preparing a backlog of products. It is important to understand what products you will develop in alignment with the company strategy by consulting business colleagues and managers. It is also beneficial for the CIO or CTO to join strategic or technical committees to get insights into the company's strategic direction and product backlog.
     - A flexible technical plan is essential, accommodating API management and other necessary systems. Consider vendor roadmaps, benchmarking industry approaches, and scouting startups for innovative solutions.
     - Evaluate strategic mergers and acquisitions for efficiency, analyze in-house versus purchasing solutions, and ensure scalability in your infrastructure. Link IT strategies to business activities for calculated ROI and investment cases.

2. **Development Models:**
   - In-house: High control and motivation.
   - Outsource: Fixed cost, less risk.
   - Outstaff: Balance control and flexibility.

3. **Contracts and Vendors:**
   - Plan resources with contractors for a year.
   - Include extra costs for project changes.
   - Align tools and practices with vendors.

4. **Team Structure:**
   - Separate teams by product, platform, or tech.
   - Use a middle team to bridge business and tech.

5. **Process Efficiency:**
   - Use Lean Six Sigma to reduce waste.
   - Identify and address overproduction, waiting, and defects.
   - Efficiency in technology management can be enhanced by implementing Lean Six Sigma methodologies to identify and eliminate waste. Focus on reducing overproduction, waiting times, and defects in processes.
